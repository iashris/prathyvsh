## Maths ⋂ Programming ⋂ Design

I am a user interface designer turned developer turned math amateur who focuses on [lambda calculus](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1188787773441888257), and analysis. I enjoy making cognitive maps and interfaces to understand science and philosophy so that an enthusiast can accessibly understand the lay of the land of technical subjects.

As a part of my explorations, I was lead to track the history of these subjects. I actively catalogue some of these:

- [History of Lambda Calculus](https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-lambda-calculus)
- [History of Logic](https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-logic)
- [History of Notation](https://github.com/prathyvsh/notation)
