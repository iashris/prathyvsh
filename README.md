## Maths ⋂ Programming ⋂ Design

I am a user interface designer turned developer turned mathematician who focuses on [Lambda Calculus](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1188787773441888257), type theory, and category theory. I am making cognitive maps to understand science and philosophy so that an enthusiast can accessibly understand the lay of the land of technical subjects.

As a part of my explorations, I was lead to track the history of these subjects. I catalogue the summaries of some of these explorations:

- [History of Logic](https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-logic)
- [History of Lambda Calculus](https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-lambda-calculus)
- [History of Notation](https://github.com/prathyvsh/notation)
- [History of Science](https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-science)
- [History of Philosophy](https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-philosophy)
